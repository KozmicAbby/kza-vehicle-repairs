# vehicle-repairs
An NPC roadside repair system for QB-Core at config locations and lets players pay cash for a full vehicle repair. To encourage role play the service is unavailable when certain jobs are on duty. While I understand this is a simple script, we all know or have been in the spot that pre-made scripts are just easier.
