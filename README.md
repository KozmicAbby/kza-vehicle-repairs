An NPC roadside repair system for QB-Core at config locations and lets players pay cash for a full vehicle repair. To encourage role play the service is unavailable when certain jobs are on duty. While I understand this is a simple script, we all know or have been in the spot that pre-made scripts are just easier.

**Features**
- NPC repairs for multiple locations.
- Config prices for each spot, some may be cheaper.
- Toggle blips for each location
- Qb-target interaction.
- Emergency service discount, preset to "police" and "ambulance".
- Job check to encourage interactions.
- Vehicle fix while keeping your fuel. Working with lc_fuel, but easy to use another.
- Lightweight plug in and play resource.

**Setup**
Relocate and reprice the mechanics in the config to your liking.
Start the resource after qb-core.

**Common Issues**
- If you do not want the PD/Medical discount or need to add to the job list, it will be near the top of your server.lua
